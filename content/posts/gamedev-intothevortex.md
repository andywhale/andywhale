I have always wanted to create a 2D puzzle game, and this is my first foray into the venture. The idea started off as a grid based puzzle game, and quickly morphed into a 2D / 3D puzzler.

At this point the prototype has become pretty complex to play, and so may well be consigned to a virtual dusty drawer, but enjoyable to make.
