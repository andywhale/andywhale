At Numiko we are blessed with amazing clients, this peaks when we get the privilege of working with clients who are truly passionate about helping people, from the initial kick-off the passion shone through making it impossible to give anything less than 100%.

I was fortunate enough to take up the development lead position and plan and implement every aspect of the back-end of the build, continuing to refine our approach to Drupal 8 builds while focusing on flexibility to allow the client to make the website work for them as hard as possible.

All of this had to be focused around three user principles; educate, inspire and invest. Allowing us to be focused with our UX on both back and front-end, and providing the tools for the client in the future.
