This is another example of no clear planning creating a game, I started wanting to create a maze game for my little boy, it began as a handmade maze, and then a self generating maze.

You can try it yourself at https://maze.andywhale.co.uk

From there it was just a case of integrating the Google VR library and putting the player in the action.

Enter the unity asset store and its become a VR space maze.
