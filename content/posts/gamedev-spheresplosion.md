My first play with unity and c# to make a "game" of sorts, keeping the concept very simple, click the blocks to get rid of them, different colour blocks have different actions. The aim being to get rid of all purple spheres.

 * Yellow = Dissappear
 * Red = Explode
 * Blue = Generate new blocks
 * Green = Teleport back to starting point with all touching blocks
